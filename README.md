Smushy's Core Library
=====================
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This library is a standard library replacement for my C projects.
It's a cross-platform library that provides math types & functions
(suitable for game development), string functions, io and multi-threading functions.

## Requirements
- clang or gcc
- [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (only on Windows or if cross-compiling to it)
- [Doxygen >= 1.9.7](https://www.doxygen.nl/) (for generating documentation)

## Limitations
- currently only Windows and GNU/Linux are supported.
- WASM32 and WASM64 support is planned but not yet implemented.
